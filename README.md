# express-dashboard-2015
2015 CMP express highway performance dashboard

This application was originally implemented by Ben Krepp using OpenLayers 2.13 and D3.js version 3. It was subsequently migrated to OpenLayers 3.x and D3.js version 4 by Ethan Ebinger. The revision history of the first version being somewhat difficult (and time-consuming) to reconstruct, this repo is being initialized with the code for the baseline of the second version.

This application makes use of the following external resources:

* Version 1.11.1 of the jQuery library
* Version 1.10.4 of the jQuery-ui library
* Version 2.4.3 of the Proj4.js library
* Version 4.200 of the OpenLayers library
* Version 4.8.0 of the D3 library
* The d3-tip library
* The CTPS Accessible Grid Object library (in a separate repo)
* A custom build of version 2.8.2 of the modernizr.js library that tests for SVG support in the browser
